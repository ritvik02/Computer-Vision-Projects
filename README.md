## [Automated Visual Fruit Detection for Harvesting](https://github.com/ritvik02/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/automated%20visual%20fruit%20detection%20for%20harvesting)   (Ongoing Research Project)
Under Development


## [Lane Line Detection](https://github.com/ritvik02/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/Lane%20Line%20Detection)


## [Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-rays](https://github.com/ritvik02/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/Pneumonia%20Detection%20on%20Chest%20X-rays)
-	Used the ResNet50 architecture to train a model for detecting pneumonia on medical images.
-	Applied discriminative learning rates and achieved an accuracy of 96.33 % .
-	Successfully reduced the training time without much compromise in model performance by switching to mixed 
precision training and achieved an accuracy of 95.82 %.
