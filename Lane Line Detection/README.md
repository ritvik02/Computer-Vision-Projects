## Lane Line Detection

This project tries to detect Lane lines on Road Images using Python and OpenCV. It works reasonably well for images with low brightness as well (after testing transformations to different color spaces).

-	Implemented a pipeline using OpenCV for detecting lane lines in images and videos of roads in Python for navigation in an autonomous vehicle.
-	Used Canny edge detection to detect edges, followed by Hough transform to detect prominent lines in the Region of Interest.


## Dataset
The processing has been carried out on the Caltech Pedestrian and Nexet datasets.
