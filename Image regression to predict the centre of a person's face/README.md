# Image regression to predict the centre of a person's face

Image regression is an application of deep learning where we have a dataset thatâ€™s annotated in a certain way. For example, for every image in our dataset, we would have the co-ordinates of the eyes of that person. We then train a model to predict these co-ordinates for new images.
